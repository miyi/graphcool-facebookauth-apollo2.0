# Facebook Authentication Example (with React & Apollo)

This is an authentication example based on the [Facebook Authentication](https://github.com/graphcool/templates/tree/master/auth/facebook) template.

## Getting Started

### 1. Download the example

```sh
curl https://codeload.github.com/graphcool-examples/react-graphql/tar.gz/master | tar -xz --strip=1 react-graphql-master/authentication-with-facebook-and-apollo
cd authentication-with-facebook-and-apollo/server
```

### 2. Create your Graphcool service

```sh
# Install latest version of the Graphcool CLI
npm install -g graphcool

# Install dependencies and deploy service
yarn install
graphcool deploy
```

When prompted which cluster you want to deploy to, choose any of the **Shared Clusters** options (`shared-eu-west-1`, `shared-ap-northeast-1` or `shared-us-west-2`).

> Note: The service's schema is created based on the type definitions in [`./server/types.graphql`](./server/types.graphql).


### 3. Connect the app with your GraphQL API

Copy the `Simple API` endpoint to `./src/index.js` as the `uri` argument in the `createNetworkInterface` call:

```js
const networkInterface = createNetworkInterface({ uri: '__SIMPLE_API_ENDPOINT__' })
```

### 4. Connect the app with Facebook

#### 4.1. Create your Facebook app

Follow the [instructions in the Facebook documentation](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/apps/register) to create your own Facebook app.

Once your app was created, you need to enable _Facebook Login_ and configure it with the right information.

Select **Facebook Login** in the left sidebar (listed under **PRODUCTS**) and add the following URLs to the **Valid OAuth redirects URIs**: `http://localhost:3000`.

#### 4.2. Enter Facebook app data

Open the **Dashboard** in the sidebar of your Facebook app and copy the **App ID** as well as the **API Version** into `App.js`. Set them as the values for the two constants `FACEBOOK_APP_ID` and `FACEBOOK_API_VERSION` which are defined on top of the file.

### 5. Install dependencies & run locally

```sh
cd ..
yarn install
yarn start 
```

You can now use the app at `http://localhost:3000`.
